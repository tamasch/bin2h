A small (and common) tool for converting binary data to a C-style uchar array for compiling straight into C/C++ code.

Originally written because I couldn't find what I was looking for with Google. It is very similar to the one found on http://www.programmersheaven.com/download/16517/download.aspx, I knocked up a fresh version from scratch since the linked is a 16bit binary (won't run on a 64bit system) and the code is a little out of date now.

Published in the hope that it will save someone an hour or two.


(PS: I'd be fascinated to know what this is getting used for - get in touch! :) )
